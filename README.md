# Vuforia-Sample-Project

This is a sample project for Vuforia AR on Unity. 

There are three image targets with the first image target having a simple static child that is a cube. The second image target has a rotating cube as its child and the third image target has a spawn point which will spawn the object that the user selects using the three buttons at the top, Cube, Capsule, and Rectangle. The Reset IT 3 button will reset the third image target to have no child once again.
